# Cinema Web Platform: A Robust Three-Tier Application in Java

The Cinema Web Platform is a sophisticated Java-based application that replicates the functionality of a cinema website. Developed as part of the Programming on the Internet and World Wide Web course at my university, this project showcases a comprehensive understanding and application of three-tier architecture and server-side technologies.

## Key Components

1. **Three-Tier Architecture**: The application employs a robust three-tier architecture, segregating the system into the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data storage layer. This approach enhances scalability and maintainability.

2. **Server-Side Technologies**: The application leverages Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) for server-side processing, ensuring efficient data handling and dynamic web content generation.

3. **Database Connectivity**: The application incorporates SQL for data storage and retrieval, demonstrating effective database management practices and seamless integration with Java.
